Mechanics & Feelings

Different car speeds → Keeps the player alert and nervous because patterns aren’t predictable

Instant death on hit → Makes every decision feel serious and risky

Risk-based score multiplier → Encourages players to take bold moves instead of always playing safe

Removing a Mechanic
If instant death is removed, the tension drops a lot. Players would rush more and make careless moves, and the game would feel less intense and more forgiving overall.
