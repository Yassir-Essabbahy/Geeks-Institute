Goal

Cross as many streets as possible without getting hit.

Rules

Vehicles move at different speeds

Traffic lights change dynamically

One hit = death

Core Loop

Observe traffic → Move or wait → Cross → Score increases

Feedback

Crossing high-risk streets (fast / luxury cars) gives x3 score multiplier

Near misses give bonus points and strong sound/visual feedback

SCAMPER

Substitute: cars → bikes, animals, robots

Combine: crossing + time pressure or collectibles

Adapt: Frogger-style moving platforms (buses)

Modify: narrower streets, faster cars

Put to use: road-safety learning for kids

Eliminate: no traffic lights, rely on sight & sound

Reverse: control traffic to keep pedestrians safe
